/**
 * Read-only diagnosis for `gjc setup paseo --check`.
 *
 * Two layers, deliberately separated:
 *
 * - L1 is everything GJC can observe on the filesystem. Any non-clean L1
 *   condition is `drift`, checked first and independent of the daemon.
 * - L2 is a bounded probe of the Paseo daemon. It only runs when L1 is clean,
 *   and it partitions the remaining three states by its own outcome.
 *
 * That ordering is what makes the four states mutually exclusive: `pass`,
 * `stale`, and `skipped` all require a clean L1 and are then distinguished
 * solely by whether the daemon answered and whether it listed our entry. A
 * daemon that is merely down can never produce `drift`.
 *
 * This module never writes. `stale` in particular must not restart anything --
 * Paseo has no reload verb and its own skill forbids restarting without
 * explicit user approval, which is exactly why `stale` exists as a state.
