/**
 * Four-step install saga with reverse-order compensation.
 *
 * GJC writes to four files it does not own, across two applications, with no
 * distributed lock available. Nothing here can be made atomic across files, so
 * the design is instead: refuse early, record enough to recover, and undo in
 * reverse on failure.
 *
 * Forward order is fixed:
 *   1. `~/.paseo/config.json` provider entry + provider-key provenance
 *   2. `~/.paseo/orchestration-preferences.json` seeded roles + seeded-key provenance
 *   3. `<agentDir>/paseo-skills/` symlink bridge
 *   4. `~/.gjc/agent/config.yml` `skills.customDirectories` append
 *
 * Steps 1 and 2 each mutate a Paseo file AND the GJC provenance ledger. Those
 * are separate files, so a durable intent record is written BEFORE either one,
 * carrying preflight and expected-post identities for BOTH. Recovery classifies
 * each file independently and refuses whenever the ledger diverged.
