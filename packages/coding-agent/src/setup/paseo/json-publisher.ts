/**
 * Byte-safe JSON publication for files another application owns.
 *
 * Paseo owns `~/.paseo/config.json` and offers no lock API, so every write here
 * is conservative by construction:
 *
 * - A round-trip fidelity self-check re-serializes the UNMODIFIED parse and
 *   refuses to write unless it is byte-identical to the original. Paseo writes
 *   2-space JSON with a trailing newline; anything else means our formatting
 *   assumption no longer holds and guessing would silently rewrite the file.
 * - A compare-and-swap re-reads the file immediately before publishing, so a
 *   concurrent write between our read and our rename is detected, not clobbered.
 * - Publication is temp-write plus rename, never a direct write to the target.
 * - Backups land beside the original at mode 0600, because `config.json` holds
 *   `daemon.auth.password`.
 *
 * This module carries NO ownership, seeding, or removal policy. Those live in
 * the per-target adapters so this file stays small enough to audit.
