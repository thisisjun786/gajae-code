 * directory-style lock, so a `<file>.lock/` DIRECTORY left by an older runtime is a real
 * on-disk shape this code still has to survive.
 *
 * Both shapes are therefore handled, and neither is guessed at: `lstat` decides which one
 * is present, a directory is evaluated by the generic protocol's own implementation, and

 * that only ever `open(..., "wx")`s the path is a real contender this protocol cannot
 * exclude, and interleaving its create with a reclaimer's delete is what corrupts
 * ownership. So every current transition of that pathname — acquire, stale reclaim,
 * write-failure cleanup, release — is made under this separate claim. Only pathname
 * bookkeeping happens inside it; the caller's state-file operation never does.
 *
 * The claim is an atomic empty directory at `<file>.lock.transition`; its machine-qualified
 * owner record is the sibling `<file>.lock.transition.owner`. `mkdir` admits exactly one
 * contender, while the held directory prevents a successor until release unlinks the
 * validated sidecar and atomically `rmdir`s the claim. A crash before either step leaves a
 * fail-closed directory for explicit recovery; concurrent automatic reclaim cannot prove
 * that a directory + sibling sidecar still name the claim it inspected.
 *
 * The separate sidecar keeps the claim directory empty, which is what makes `rmdir` the
 * identity-safe portable release primitive. The path stays distinct from `<file>.lock`
 * (whose regular-file owner format base writers read) and from the outer
